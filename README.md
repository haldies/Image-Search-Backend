# Image Search Backend

## Project Overview
This project implements an **image search** backend system. The system allows users to search for images based on visual features. The main functionality includes:
- Extracting features from images using a **feature extraction** algorithm.
- Searching for similar images based on extracted features.

The backend is built using Python and includes APIs for feature extraction, image uploads, and search queries. It also connects to a frontend interface for users to interact with the search functionality.

```


## Features
1. **Image Upload & Search**: Users can upload an image, and the system will return visually similar images based on precomputed features.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Uses a pre-trained model to extract features from uploaded images.
3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /upload`: Uploads an image for feature extraction and searching.
   - `GET /search`: Retrieves similar images based on the feature vector of the uploaded image.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageSearch_Backend.git
cd ImageSearch_Backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the server
Run the Flask server to handle image uploads and search queries:
```bash
python server.py
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000/`.

### 4. Access the frontend
Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the UI for uploading images and searching.

## How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., ResNet, VGG) to extract feature vectors from uploaded images. 
   - This is handled in `feature_extractor.py`, which processes the images and stores their feature vectors for quick search retrieval.
   
2. **Image Search**:
   - When a user uploads an image, its features are extracted and compared to existing image features stored in the `feature/` directory.
   - The system uses distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity or Euclidean distance) to find and return the most similar images from the `img/` directory.

## Example API Usage

### Upload an Image
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@path_to_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/upload
```

### Search for Similar Images
After uploading an image, the API will return a list of image paths that are visually similar.

## Future Work
- Add real-time image indexing.
- Implement more sophisticated search techniques (e.g., using a custom model or fine-tuning).
- Add more search options like **text-based image search** or **multi-modal retrieval**.
